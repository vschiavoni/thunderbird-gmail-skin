# Snooze conversations

Snooze moves mail to an account-specific **Thunder-G Snoozed** folder and keeps a
local reminder to return it to the Inbox. It is separate from Gmail's native
snooze: another device does not run Thunder-G's scheduler for this profile.

## Set a reminder

1. Select the conversation in the message list or open it in the reader.
2. Choose the toolbar clock. With **Gmail keyboard shortcuts** enabled, `b` also
   opens the picker when focus is outside an editor or text field.
3. Choose a preset or **Pick date & time**. The menu displays the proposed day and time.
4. For a custom reminder, select a calendar day and enter the local time. The clock
   control opens separate hour/minute lists; arrow keys and Home/End navigate them.
5. Choose **Save** and check the operation's status. The picker can close once the
   reminder is stored while message transfers are still running in the background.

Custom dates must be valid and in the future. Closing/cancelling the picker before
saving creates no reminder. An error after saving can mean that a reminder exists
but a transfer is incomplete: inspect the actual source and holding folders.

### Preset times

The current picker uses the computer's local time:

| Preset | When offered | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Later today | Before 18:00 | Today at 18:00 |
| Tomorrow | Always | Tomorrow at 08:00 |
| Later this week | Monday or Tuesday | Wednesday at 08:00 |
| This weekend | Sunday through Friday | The upcoming Saturday at 08:00 |
| Next week | Always | The upcoming Monday at 08:00 |

Review the displayed date rather than relying on a preset's name alone.

## Browse or return postponed mail

Enable **Folder Modes → Snoozed** in the folder pane. Its visibility is remembered.
Expand the account row to inspect postponed messages in that account's holding folder.

To bring mail back immediately, move it from **Thunder-G Snoozed** to the **same
account's Inbox** using the client's move command. Check the destination after
the move completes. Do not delete the holding folder or clear profile preferences
as a way to cancel a reminder.

To postpone it to a different time using the documented folder workflow, return
it to the Inbox, let the move complete, then snooze it again with the new date.
If a move or reminder reports an error, resolve that first rather than repeatedly
creating more reminders for the same mail.

## What returns, and when

- Read/unread state is preserved.
- A new reply in the same account can return the conversation early and clear
  the reminder.
- Sent originals remain in Sent.
- Returned mail rises by its return time in date-sorted Inbox views. Its original
  message date is unchanged; other sort modes retain native ordering.
- While the client is closed or offline, delivery back to the Inbox waits. Overdue
  reminders are processed after reopening and going online.

A reminder is account-scoped. For example, postponing mail in a work account
uses that account's holding folder and Inbox; it does not move the message to a
personal account merely because both appear under Unified Folders.

## Reminder and message movement

The reminder and the folder transfer are separate operations. Follow the status
and check folder membership if either operation reports an error.

The installed extension stores reminders locally. The homepage demo uses a short
in-memory timer and does not move real messages or preserve reminders after reload.

## If a conversation does not return

1. Confirm the account exists and is online.
2. Inspect both its Inbox and **Thunder-G Snoozed**, allowing synchronization to finish.
3. Check the local date/time and whether the reminder is actually overdue.
4. Record any status/error and the affected account/folder names, without exposing
   private mail or credentials.
5. Use the [missing-reminder checklist](../docs/troubleshooting.md#a-snoozed-conversation-has-not-returned)
   before changing stored data.

A stored reminder is not evidence that all messages were moved successfully.
Disabling/uninstalling the add-on stops its scheduler; return postponed mail first
if you will no longer use the feature. Label backups do not transfer reminder jobs.
