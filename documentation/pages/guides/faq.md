# Frequently asked questions

## Does it require Gmail or a new account?

No. Thunder-G uses the accounts already configured in Thunderbird or Betterbird.
The optional Gmail label-name importer has its own Google setup; it is not needed
for labels, local search, the reader or snooze.

## Which clients and platforms work?

Use the [compatibility table](../../../README.md#compatibility) for the declared version
range and combinations actually tested. The current manifest admits Thunderbird
153–159.x; admitting a version is not evidence that every feature has been tested
there. Betterbird has its own recorded version/platform checks.

## Do I need Python, Node.js or Bun?

No, not to install a released XPI. The extension development workflow uses Python
and Node.js. Building this documentation website separately uses Bun and Python.

## Why can I not sort or resize the columns?

Column headers are hidden by default. Enable **Preferences → Inbox → Show column
headers**, make the native adjustment, then hide them again if desired. Sorting
and widths are retained. See [inbox customization](inbox-and-appearance.md).

## Are labels missing, hidden or deleted?

These are different states. Enable the native **Tags** folder-pane mode for the
Labels sidebar. Use **More** to reveal hidden entries, and check **In message list**
if a tag exists in the picker/sidebar but its chip is absent beside subjects.
Hiding a label does not remove its assignments. See the [visibility walkthrough](labels-workflow.md#keep-the-sidebar-and-list-readable).

## Why did a label change affect a sent reply too?

Tag operations resolve the conversation, including available sent replies, and
update its messages together. The active message can determine a numeric toggle's
starting state; it does not restrict the update to that one message. See
[label scope](labels-workflow.md#apply-an-existing-label) before bulk changes.

## Will labels and colored stars look the same on another device?

Not necessarily. Native keyword/tag synchronization depends on both the provider
and client; cross-client Exchange tag synchronization is unsupported. Colored
markers use a Thunder-G message property in addition to the native starred flag.
A label export does not transfer colored-star choices or all extension settings.

## Why are the reader and in-window editors absent?

They are experimental and off by default. Enable the relevant switches in Preferences,
disable the separate Thunderbird Conversations add-on, and reopen from the list.
The [reader and writing guide](conversations-and-writing.md) covers their separate switches.

## Did compaction remove messages from a long conversation?

No. With **Compact long conversations** enabled, six or more messages are initially
represented by the first message, last two and a counter for hidden middle messages.
The selected message and unread messages also remain visible. Click the counter to reveal the rest. This changes presentation only.

## Does snooze work when the client is closed?

The scheduler runs locally. Overdue reminders wait until the client is reopened
and online. This is not Gmail's native snooze, and a label backup does not migrate
scheduled reminders. See [snooze](snooze.md).

## Why does a search miss an attachment or body phrase?

Operator searches do not download entire mailboxes. The necessary body/MIME content
must be available locally. Spam and Trash are excluded unless explicitly included.
Results are snapshots; submit again after synchronization. See
[search troubleshooting](find-and-organize-mail.md#when-expected-mail-is-missing).

## Does Gmail import restore all my message labels?

No. It copies custom label names and hierarchy only. To move native tags and
assignments between installations containing the same mail, use
[Export labels and assignments](moving-to-another-computer.md).

## Why does a sender logo not appear with DKIM Verifier installed?

An ordinary published DKIM Verifier installation does not supply the current local
integration prototype. BIMI also needs an aligned successful result and a usable
sender-published logo, and is off by default. See [sender logos](sender-logos.md).

## Is the homepage mail preview connected to my account?

No. It is a browser simulation with fictional messages. It does not load the
extension, connect to mail accounts or send email; changes reset on reload.
Its small set of controls is not a complete feature or compatibility test.

## How do I update, disable or report a problem?

Use [updates and maintenance](../docs/updates.md) for automatic updates, removal
and old-installer migration. For bugs, follow the
[report checklist](../docs/troubleshooting.md#report-a-reproducible-problem), recording
the client version, platform, relevant settings and exact steps. Redact private mail.
